    <title>Some basic tags used with paragraph</title>

<body>
    <h1>This is &lt;h1&gt; tag</h1>
    <h4>
        this is <br> &lt;br&gt; tag<br>
        this is <b>bold tag</b> &lt;b&gt;<br />
        This is <i>italic tag </i> &lt;i&gt;<br>
        This is <u>Underline tag</u> &lt;u&gt;<br>
        This is <big>big tag </big>&lt;big&gt;<br>
        This is <small>small tag</small>&lt;small&gt;<br>
        This is X<sub>2</sub> &lt;sub&gt; tag<br>
        This is 10<sup>5</sup> &lt;sup&gt; tag<br>
        Example: H<sub>2</sub>O <br>
        10<sup>5</sup> = 100000<br>
    </h4>
    <p>This is a paragraph where we write <b>something</b> somethig...</p>
    <!--We can see, two paragraph tags are making required space in between the texts.-->
    <p>This is my <b>another</b> paragraph <i>where</i> we can write <b><i>something else</i></b> which is related to previous context.</p>
    <p>This is the order of the tags metter with tht html but white space doesn't with the html. So if want to put some blank lines in that case you need to use the br tag like this<br>this was a line brack. But this is not a another paragraph so there will not be any extra line space as we see with the other p tag!.
    </p>
    <p><big>Now</big>, if we <small>want</small> to use a horizontal line in that case there is a tag called hr tag and this will work like this: </p>
    <hr />
    <p> hr tag will not work if you want to put this into a paragraph tag</p>
